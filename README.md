A work in progress.  Testing my skills by trying to create a working graphing calculator.

Currently using chartjs to portray my graphs.  I have it working pretty dynamically for basic functions like add, subtract, multiply, and division.

If you have any insight or suggestion don't be afraid to make pull requests or send me messages.
